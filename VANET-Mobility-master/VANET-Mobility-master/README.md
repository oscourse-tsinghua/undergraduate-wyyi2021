# VANET-Mobility

Here, we simulate V2V and V2I connectivity in Matlab using car following, lane changing models and entry and exit ramps on a 4-Highways, 3-Ramps scenario. For project description, see PDF file ENTS749C_project. To view the graphs, see report. 

P.S : Simulation runs for different road traffic densities and for 10 minutes for each density in millisecond intervals.

We also simulate V2V connectivity at road intersections to better understand the transmission range required for successful connectivity.
